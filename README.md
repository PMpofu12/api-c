# api-market-data

This api retrieves current and historical crypto data from the coingecko api. It is an abstraction of the CoinGecko api. You can find more documentation for that api here https://www.coingecko.com/api/documentation.

## Still To Do:
1. Add unit, integration and acceptance testing to this api. 
2. Add CI/CD to this repo (including stickers for coverage and successful builds).
2. Find a way and a place to deploy this api (hopefully use docker containers and k8s clusters).
